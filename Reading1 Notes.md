Reading 1:

The article reads like a survey of various developments in exploring museum collections online.
In comparison to the offline object collection, only a small percentage of objects ~6% have at least 1 digitized image.

Major points:

Michael Whitelaw (TedX talk):  See the whole collection at once.  "Understand more about the collection", relationships.

* Doesn't this seem to emphasize the museum collection itself?

Search is a primary discovery mechanism, but requires one to already know something about the collection or what they are looking for, and how to query effectively.

"Data as cultural/critical/creative material"
"Digital transformation of our heritage"
Towards a "generous" ethos:  Show rich content, reveal connections, explore.

**Major attempts at Generous Interfaces:**

**Metaphors**:
  * "Lightbox" -show many items, zoom with magnifying glass
  * "Lightbox" with collection grouping, by time decade

**Museum Re-creation:**
  * "Gallery Hang"
  * "Emphasis on collection itself"
  * "Recreating reasons why people go to museums in the first place"
  
**Serendipity:**  
  * "Magic Tate Ball":  time, date, location, weather to show an image
  * "Text message":  "Send me some sunshine."
  
**Dimensions:**
  * "Maps & Geographies" - where items originated, or can be seen, etc
  * "Color" 
  * "Time"  
  * "Subject"
  * "Material"
  * "Multiple/Combination Dimensions"
 
 **Deep Analysis:**
    * "Identify Objects, faces, composition and context", e.g. Tate finding "pair" artworks

>*When they click a tag, a timeline visualisation is generated of images of the other objects sharing that tag â€“ arranged by date. The user can then click on further tags, to generate new timeline visualisations around the same starting image, viewing that image against contrasting historical narratives.*

**Considerations:**
  * Hetero/homogeneous collections. 
  * Thin meta data

**Opportunities**
  * Linking data across items
  * Increase discovery
