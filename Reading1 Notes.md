Major points:

Michael Whitelaw (TedX talk):  See the whole collection at once.  "Understand more about the collection", relationships.

Search is a primary discovery mechanism, but requires one to already know something about the collection or what they are looking for, and how to query effectively.

"Data as cultural/critical/creative material"
"Digital transformation of our heritage"
Towards a "generous" ethos:  Show rich content, reveal connections, explore.

**Major attempts at Generous Interfaces:**

**Metaphors**:
⋅⋅* "Lightbox" -show many items, zoom with magnifying glass
⋅⋅* "Lightbox" with collection grouping, by time decade

**Museum Re-creation:**
⋅⋅* "Gallery Hang"

**Dimensions:**
⋅⋅* "Maps & Geographies" - where items originated, or can be seen, etc
⋅⋅* "Color" 
⋅⋅* "Time"

The user can then click on further tags, to generate new timeline visualisations around the same starting image, viewing that image against contrasting historical narratives.*
