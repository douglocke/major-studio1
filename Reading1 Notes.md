Reading 1:

The article reads as a survey of various developments in exploring museum collections online.  It offers little in criticism or opinion but allows us to explore some of the opportunties and work done to date in exploring online museum collections.

Important Fact:  In comparison to the offline object collection, only a small percentage of objects ~6% have at least 1 digitized image.

Major points:

Michael Whitelaw (TedX talk):  See the whole collection at once.  "Understand more about the collection", relationships.

* Allows us to better appreciate size, scale of the collection,  as well as relationships.   Doesn't this seem to emphasize the museum collection itself as primary.  Analogy:  "Earth from space". 

Search is a primary discovery mechanism, but requires one to already know something about the collection or what they are looking for, and how to query effectively.

**Thinking about opportunities & objectives**:
Whitelaw'a Proposed Objective: Switch towards a "generous" ethos  
Opportunity provided by museum & technology: "Data as cultural/critical/creative material"
Opportunity provided by museum & technology: "Digital transformation of our heritage"
Our opportunity: Show rich content, reveal connections, explore +(what else)+?

**Some existing attempts at Generous Interfaces:**

**Simulated/"Virtual" Examination**:
  * "Unlimited Lightbox" -show many items, zoom with magnifying glass, seems literalist
  * "Lightbox" with collection grouping, by time decade

**Museum Re-creation:**
  * "Gallery Hang", another literalist idea
  * "Emphasis on collection itself", the museum is what is important
  * "What are the reasons why people go to museums in the first place".  
  
**Casual:  Serendipity:**  
  * "Magic Tate Ball":  time, date, location, weather to show an image
  * "Text message":  "Send me some sunshine."
  
**Research: Dimensions:**
  * "Maps & Geographies" - where items originated, or can be seen, etc
  * "Color" 
  * "Time"  
  * "Subject"
  * "Material"
  * "Multiple/Combination Dimensions"
 
 **Deep Analysis:**
    * "Identify Objects, faces, composition and context", e.g. Tate finding "pair" artworks

>*When they click a tag, a timeline visualisation is generated of images of the other objects sharing that tag â€“ arranged by date. The user can then click on further tags, to generate new timeline visualisations around the same starting image, viewing that image against contrasting historical narratives.*

**Considerations:**
  * Hetero/homogeneous collections. 
  * Thin meta data

**Opportunities**
  * Linking data across items
  * Increase discovery
